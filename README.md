# Bank Transaction Analysis-Project
Customer behavior analysis on the basis of transaction

Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, income, values, lifestyle, and more. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits.

About Dataset
This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data contains information such as - customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.

    TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction
    CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
    CustomerDOB: Customer's date of birth 
    CustGender: Customer's gender 
    CustLocation: Location of the customer (e.g., JAMSHEDPUR, MUMBAI).

    TransactionDate: Date the transaction occurred 
    TransactionTime: Time of the transaction in integer format 
    TransactionAmount (INR): The amount transacted in Indian Rupees


Interesting Analysis Ideas
According to a report from Ernst & Young, â€œA more granular understanding of consumers is no longer a nice-to-have item, but a strategic and competitive imperative for banking providers. Customer understanding should be a living, breathing part of everyday business, with insights underpinning the full range of banking operations.

    1. Perform Clustering / Segmentation on the dataset and identify popular customer groups along with their definitions/rules
    2. Perform Location-wise analysis to identify regional trends in India
    3. Perform transaction-related analysis to identify interesting trends that can be used by a bank to improve / optimi their user experiences
    4. Customer Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis
    5. Network analysis or Graph analysis of customer data.
